            <p className='text-center md:text-left w-full'>My tech journey began at Makers Academy, where I discovered my passion for web development. I started as a Junior Web Developer, designing solutions tailored to clientsâ€™ needs and optimising websites for SEO. Driven by curiousity and a desire to grow, 
            I transitioned into Salesforce, becoming a Certified Developer. Today, I collaborate with a dynamic team of building features that create real impact and drive meaningful business results.
